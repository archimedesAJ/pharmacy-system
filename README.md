# pharmacy-system
This is a system I built as my end of semester project for Data Structures & Algorithms.This system was built with java.
This system helps physicians/pharmacists search through available drugs very fast, add drugs, edit drug and delete a drug. 
All the CRUD operation run on a time complexity of O(logn). I used trie data structure which helps in traversing through the data faster.  
Software used; Java & Java Swing Trie data structure algorithm
